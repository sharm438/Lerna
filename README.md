Automated tuning of EC tools

The workflow is simplified as follows:
1) The uncorrected reads are converted to torch tensors on which the Language model is trained
2) The reads are corrected (for multiple 'k' values) using a standard Error correcting tool, for example, LoRDEC
3) The corrected reads are converted to tensors on which the Language model evaluation is done
4) Simulated annealing is run on the perplexity values generated by evaluation where the 'k' value corresponding to minimum perplexity is chosen

Requirements:
--PyTorch

File "pbsim_10k.fasta" contains 10000 uncorrected reads generated using a PacBio simulator on the E-coli genome  
File "create_train_tensors.py" processes the uncorrected reads to generate torch tensors for training  
  Usage: python create_train_tensors.py --w --file  
    where 'w' is the word length and 'file' contains the uncorrected reads in fasta format  
  Example: python create_train_tensors.py --4 --pbsim_10k.fasta  
  This generates and saves two tensors, "train_data.pt" and "train_targets.pt" which will be used by the Language model for training  
File "train.py" trains the language model for 200 epochs and saves it as "LM.pkl". It also generates a log file as "log.txt"  
  Usage: python train.py  
We then run an Error correcting tool LoRDEC for multiple values of 'k' to generate the corrected reads which we have uploaded here with subscripts 'cor.fasta'  
File "create_test_tensors.py" processes the corrected reads to generate torch tensors for testing  
  Usage: python create_test_tensors.py --w  
  By default, it does this for k = 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 31, 37, 45, 55, 67, 75, 81, 89, 97. This can be modified by editing the k_vals list in the code  
File "test.py" evaluates the Language model on the test data by iterating over the test tensors of all the above mentioned 'k' values which can be modified by editing the 'k_vals' list in the code  
  Usage: python test.py  
  Example: python test.py 
  It generates the average loss value of testing, which is the translated to perplexity and used in Simulated annealing
All the intermediate files generated are uploaded at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1f7B-NMlE3FU0oiF8x5tHUZ-lcgtRyNF0?usp=sharing  
File "simulated_annealining.py" select the value of k based on the corresponding perplexity. A dictionary is constructed containing key-value pairs: the key which is k and the value which is the perplexity.  
Usage: python simulated_annealing.py Example: python simulated_annealing.py
